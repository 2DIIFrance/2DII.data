Do you want to take the longer route and answer the additional questions?}

\item{E2}{ Let’s consider you own a diversified financial portfolio (made of bonds and stocks). Such a portfolio yields a typical annual return of 4\%. Would you accept to give up a fraction of that return to have your savings fully reflect your sustainability objectives? In the slider below, please indicate the minimum annual return you would accept for your savings if you can be sure your sustainability objectives will be fully met. To help you choose, the slider shows the total compounded return you would get over 10 years for each level of annual return}

\item{F3r1}{A green saving account as an alternative to the classical saving account. Deposits to the green saving account are used by the bank to provide green loans to households and companies, which are loans that finance projects with clear environmental benefits (i.e., loans for buying energy-efficiency devices or to develop small-scall renewable energy projects).}
\item{F3r2}{A green bond fund as an alternative to the classical bond fund. In both cases, the funds buy bonds issued by large European companies from all sectors. The only difference is that the green bond fund specializes in buying "green bonds" that specifically finance environmental projects that are verified by external auditors, especially investments in energy-efficiency and renewable energy.}
\item{F3r3}{A low-carbon equity fund as an alternative to the classical equity fund. In both cases, the funds buy stocks of large European companies from all sectors. The only difference is that the low-carbon equity fund selects companies that are aligned with the objective of maintaining the global temperature increase to below 2°C. In practice, the fund selects companies that have the lowest carbon intensities of their sectors and put an extra weight of companies providing low-carbon solutions, especially in renewable energy and energy efficiency.}
\item{F3r4}{A green energy equity fund as a new sector fund. The fund only buys stocks of listed European companies operating in the sectors of renewable energy and energy efficiency.}
\item{F7}{ Please rate how interested you are to invest part of your future savings in stocks or loans to small companies in the renewable energy or energy efficiency sectors through crowdfunding platforms (instead of investing in larger companies through the stock market)}

\item{G1}{ Exclusion You have previously expressed a will to have your values be reflected in your savings / have your savings actively contribute to make a change. It is possible to find financial products that exclude from their investment scope firms involved in certain controversial activities. In practice, it means the investment universe from which the portfolio manager can choose investments will be restrained to companies that are NOT involved in the selected controversial activities. In order to meet the sustainability objective(s) you expressed, would you be interested in investing in financial products that include such a mechanism?}
\item{G2}{ Thematic Investment You have previously expressed a will to have your values be reflected in your savings / have your savings actively contribute to make a change. It is possible to invest in financial products that specifically select companies from sectors that provide solutions to specific environmental or social issues. In practice, it means that the investment universe from which the portfolio manager can choose investments will be restrained to companies involved in the selected topic only. In order to meet the sustainability objective(s) you expressed, would you be interested in investing in financial products that include such a mechanism?}
\item{G3}{ Best-in-Class You have previously expressed a will to have your values be reflected in your savings / have your savings actively contribute to make a change. It is possible to invest in financial products that specifically select companies that are the best of their industry sectors regarding environmental, social and governance issues. In practice, it means that the investment universe from which the portfolio manager can choose investments will be restrained to companies with high ESG (environmental, social, governance) ratings. In order to meet the sustainability objective(s) you expressed, would you be interested in investing in financial products that include such a mechanism?}
\item{G4}{ Impact investing You have previously expressed a will to have your values be reflected in your savings / have your savings actively contribute to make a change. It is possible to find investment funds that select their investments based on the probable impact they would have on the environment or the society. To do so, they run a careful analysis of the impact of the companies and of the additional effect of providing capital to those companies. In practice, it means that the investment universe from which the portfolio manager can choose investments will be restrained to companies with high impact potential only. In order to meet the sustainability objective(s) you expressed, would you be interested in investing in financial products that include such a mechanism?}
\item{G5}{ Engagement You have previously expressed a will to have your values be reflected in your savings / have your savings actively contribute to make a change. It is possible to find investment funds that actively engage with companies (through a constant dialogue or through exercising their voting rights during shareholders’ general assemblies) to make the companies change their business practices and model. In practice, it means the investment universe of the portfolio would be unchanged but the portfolio manager would get into an active dialogue with certain or all companies invested. In order to meet the sustainability objective(s) you expressed, would you be interested in investing in financial products that include such a mechanism?}
\item{G6}{ Profit Sharing You have previously expressed a will to have your values be reflected in your savings / have your savings actively contribute to make a change. It is possible to find financial products that donate part of the investor revenues to NGOs, charities or social enterprises serving specific social or environmental causes. In practice, it means that the composition of the portfolio would not change but part of the returns would be donated. In order to meet the sustainability objective(s) you expressed, would you be interested in investing in financial products that include such a mechanism?}
