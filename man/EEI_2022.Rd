Both funds are exactly invested the same way. The only difference between them is the intensity of climate engagement and the level of annual management fees. The climate engagement fund involves higher management fees to pay for costs associated with the climate engagement strategy. Depending on the expected returns of both products after fees, which product would you choose for the non-risky part of your savings?

\item{F17}{ Let's consider a fund named "Environmental Impact Fund". How do you understand the functioning of the fund based on this denomination?}
\item{F18}{ According to you, what should be an Impact Fund in order not to mislead investors?}
\item{F19}{ In order to finance companies proposing goods and services that actively contribute to the green energy transition, you can also invest in green Private Equity Funds Those funds buy stakes of non-listed firms directly from the firms. Investments in private equity are illiquid, expected to deliver returns that are alike or superior to investments in public equity and are interesting using an impact viewpoint (they directly finance young or small-sized companies that may have difficult access to financial markets and consequently help them to grow). If you want to know more about private equity funds, click here Private equity funds are different from public equity funds because they buy stakes of non-listed firms directly from the firms and not from other investors via stock exchanges. Until recently, those funds were restricted to institutional or wealthy investors. But new funds are currently launched to serve retail investors. Investments in private equity funds are especially illiquid because of a lock-up period (often 10 years) during which the investor commits to stay invested. As important shareholders, private equity funds have a direct connection with the management of invested companies and therefore can influence them. How interested are you to invest in green private equity funds open to retail investors?}
\item{F20}{ Another alternative to contribute to the green energy transition is to invest in green Infrastructure Funds. Green infrastructure funds are Alternative Investment Funds which invest in non-listed (debt or equity) securities of companies that operate green infrastructure projects (e.g., wind farms, energy storage facilities, photovoltaic power stations, etc.) for the long run. Like private equity funds, investments in infrastructure funds are illiquid (it is quasi-impossible to sell your shares of the fund in the first 5-7 years). How interested are you to invest in green infrastructure funds open to retail investors?}
\item{F21}{ Another alternative to contribute to the green energy transition is to invest in green Real Estate Funds. A possible strategy for Green Real Estate Funds is to buy old or decrepit buildings to retrofit them in order to decrease their energy and water consumptions. They can subsequently rent them or sell them at higher prices. Like private equity funds, investments in real estate funds are illiquid (it is quasi-impossible to sell your shares of the fund in the first 5-7 years). How interested are you to invest in green real estate funds open to retail investors?}
\item{F22}{ Another alternative to contribute to the green energy transition is to directly buy stocks or lend money to small companies through crowdfunding platforms. Some crowdfunding platforms are specialized in the financing of small companies that specifically provide solutions with clear environmental benefits, especially in the renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors. Please rate how interested you are to invest in stocks or loans to small companies in the renewable energy or energy efficiency sectors through crowdfunding platforms (instead of investing in larger companies through the stock market)}
\item{F23}{ Another alternative to contribute to the green energy transition is to buy "digital securities" of green assets via blockchain-based platforms. Digital securities are a digital representation of ownership of an underlying asset. Digital securities do share characteristics with bitcoin and cryptocurrency in that they all run on blockchain technology. Digital securities make it easy for retail investors to conduct small-scale transfers in a liquid secondary market. They enable to access a large range of financial instruments, including some that were so far not easily accessible to retail investors (for example, bonds and loans, shares of private companies, shares of private equity funds). Please rate how interested you are to invest in digital securities that contribute to the financing of renewable energy or energy efficiency projects.}
\item{J1}{ Some banks are currently proposing loans to households at cheaper interest rates to finance green projects with clear environmental benefits like â€¢ the purchase of an electric car, â€¢ the switch to energy-efficient heating devices, â€¢ the energy-efficient retrofitting of homes, â€¢ the installation of solar panels or small-scall wind turbines in homes Have you personally used such green loan facilities?}
\item{J2r1}{I was not aware of such green loans at preferential interest rates}
\item{J2r2}{I don't know which equipment to buy}
\item{J2r3}{I have already made some changes using other types of financing (conventional loans, personal savings, etc.)}
\item{J2r4}{I'm not interested into changing my equipment to more energy-efficient one because I do not trust the energy bill savings it would provide}
\item{J2r5}{I'm not interested into reducing my energy bills and/or reducing my carbon footprint}
\item{J2r6}{I'm generally not eligible to bank loans}
\item{J2r7}{I don't like to be indebted}
\item{J3}{ A new financing scheme is currently proposed in some geographic zones, called Energy Performance Contracting, to help households to make energy savings through the change of their heating devices. The change to a more energy-efficient device is fully paid by an Energy Service Company that will be reimbursed across the years through the savings on the energy bill of the household. The Energy Service Company is also taking care of potential maintenance work on the device along its lifecycle. The scheme allows end-users to benefit from a new energy device without supporting its acquisition costs, nor having to maintain the system. For the household, there is no additional payment compared to the initial situation until the contract maturity. At contract maturity, the heating device becomes the property of the host that can then fully benefits from the energy savings. Would you be interested into signing such a contract with your energy provider if it was available in your zone?}
